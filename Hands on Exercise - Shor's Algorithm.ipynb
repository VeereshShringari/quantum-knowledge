    "   - The code calculates `n`, the number of qubits needed for the target register.  \n",

    "   - **Task:** You need to implement this matrix in Section 2.\n",

    "3. **Circuit setup**  \n",

    "   - The target register is initialized to `|1⟩`.  \n",
    "   - All counting qubits are put in superposition with Hadamard gates.\n",

    "   - The function picks a random number `a` between `2` and `N-1`.  \n",
    "   - If `gcd(a, N) != 1`, we already found a non-trivial factor and can return it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Quantum order finding**  \n",
    "   - Calls `shor_order_finding(N, a)` to get the order `r` of `a mod N`.  \n",
    "   - If `r` is `None` or odd, we skip this `a` and try another.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Compute potential factors**  \n",
    "   - Using the order `r`, compute `a^(r/2) ± 1`.  \n",
    "   - Take `gcd(a^(r/2) ± 1, N)` to extract possible non-trivial factors of `N`.  \n",
    "   - If we find valid factors (not `1` or `N`), return them.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Retries**  \n",
    "   - The process is repeated for a few random choices of `a` if the first attempts fail.\n"
