I am sharing my learning on Quantum Computing

## Medium Publications
Check out my Medium articles on Quantum Computing:
- Coming soon! Follow for updates on quantum computing concepts, algorithms, and implementations.

## Contents
1. [Quantum Gates Examples](quantum_gates.py) - Implementation of basic quantum gates
2. [Shor's Algorithm](shors_algorithm.py) - Implementation of Shor's factorization algorithm

## Overview
This repository contains practical implementations of quantum computing concepts including:
- Basic quantum gates (Hadamard, Pauli-X, Pauli-Y, Pauli-Z, CNOT, etc.)
- Shor's algorithm for integer factorization
- Educational examples for learning quantum computing

## Requirements
```bash
pip install qiskit qiskit-aer numpy
```

## Usage
Each file can be run independently to see the quantum circuits in action:

```bash
python quantum_gates.py
python shors_algorithm.py
```
